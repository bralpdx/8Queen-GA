## Genetic Algorithm solution to 8 Queens Puzzle
### How to Run
Install the required packages in ```requirements.txt``` via ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```.

Then run via the command ```python n_queens.py```.

**Note:** Running in a virtual environment is recommended.

### About
This solution uses a genetic algorithm to generate new "generations" of puzzle states, until a solution to the puzzle is found.

The algorithm has a fixed population size of 100, and allows a maximum of 700 generations.
<br />The initial population is generated by randomly creating board states as chromosomes.
<br />Chromosomes are then selected to be 'parents' based off of their fitness values.

Fitness values are calculated using ```MAX_FITNESS - NUM_OF_ATTACKS```
<br />where ```MAX_FITNESS = N! / (2! * (N - 2)!)```
<br />```NUM_OF_ATTACKS = the number of pieces that are 'attacking' one another.```
<br />and ```N = board size```, in this case, ```N = 8.```

Each time two parent chromosomes are bred, a random crossover point is selected where the parents will be joined to generate the child.
<br />There is also an 8% chance of mutation occuring in the child chromosome, where the position of one queen is altered.

For example, let ```p1 = [0, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 1]``` and ```p2 = [1, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2, 0]```.
<br />Let the crossover point be index ```3``` indicating column ```4``` on the chess board; 
thus, the child will be ```[0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 0]```, since the first 3
 values of ```p1``` are 0, 5, 2, and the remaining values (from index 3 and on) are 7, 4, 6, 2, 0.
 
This breeding process is done population size times, each iteration, to ensure a constant population size.
